## What is InstaWebhooks?

InstaWebhooks is a Python package CLI that allows you to monitor Instagram accounts for new posts and send them to a Discord webhook. It is designed to be simple to use and easy to set up, with a focus on customizability and ease of use.

Internally, InstaWebhooks uses [Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/) to fetch Instagram posts and [Discord Webhooks](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) to send messages to Discord via [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which happens to be the same dependancy Instaloader uses. It uses [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) for the CLI and [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) for logging.

## Example

Below, InstaWebhooks is monitoring the Instagram account [`raenlua`](https://www.instagram.com/raenlua/) for new posts and sending them to a Discord webhook every 30 minutes and sends a message to Discord with the post URL and the owner's name.

```console
$ instawebhooks -i 1800 -c "New post from {owner_name}: {post_url}" raenlua https://discord.com/api/webhooks/0123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
07/29/2024 10:02:10 PM - INFO - Starting InstaWebhooks...
07/29/2024 10:02:14 PM - INFO - InstaWebhooks started successfully.
07/29/2024 10:02:14 PM - INFO - Monitoring 'raenlua' every 1800 seconds on https://discord.com/api/webhooks/0123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
07/29/2024 10:02:18 PM - INFO - New post sent to Discord successfully.
```
